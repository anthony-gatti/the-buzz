## General questions

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)? 
    Yes

2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?
    Yes

3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.
    All of the requirements should be met. We all worked on different design artifacts, and I think the design documents look good. Since it was only design week, no implementation was needed. 

4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
    * If incomplete, what challenges are being overcome, how are they being overcome, and by when will the team member be able to finish?
    * If complete, how do you know everyone completed the work, and at a satisfactory level?
    Everyone sent design documents, their videos, and their git logs, so I know that all of the requirements were met. 

5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"
    I looked at everyone's video and saw that they went over their design documents. The trello board was updated. I looked at each members design documents as they were sent to me and made sure they were satifactory. 

6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?
    Many of us finished design documents before the weekend, since many were busy with LeLaf. That was the main incentive. 

7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?
    No one really needed help from others for this sprint, but I think we all know we have a strong team dynamic and are not afraid to ask questions.

8. How well is the team communicating?
    Communication in the slack is good. We mostly only talk about the project, but I would say that we are more than just teammates at this point. Communication has definitely improved since the beginning of the semester.

9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.
    <!-- PM: When editing this template for your submission, you may remove this guidance -->
    * Some examples you may have reached consensus on are: 
        * acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, 
        * frequency of asynchronous communication (e.g. slack), 
        * regularity of "live" check-ins (in person, or on e.g. zoom), 
        * turn-taking or "stage sharing" during live meetings, 
        * safe ways to express discomfort or disagreement should emotions or tensions flare.
    We are to communicate with each other if we are running behind, and be honest about any tech debt we have. 

10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.

    * Challenge: XYZ
        * Status: (resolved or unresolved)
        * Description:
        * Critical steps taken to find resolution:
    We found out only recently that git logs are required for design weeks, so we lost points for that. Going forward we will make sure that they are included.


## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
    Wednesday, for about 45 minutes.

1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?
    The trello board had just enought detail. It is being used well.

2. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?
    We mostly used class time this week. 

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.
    We mitigrate risks through the use of slack. If someone has an issue, we help each other out. 

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?
    We didn't really have any team issues. We mostly just get the work done and thats it, with a bit of collaboration when needed. 

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?
    I don't have many concerns. I believe everyone will get it done on time, and if people need help we will help them. 

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.
    Honestly as PM for the first time as I PM, I forgot how to submit it, so my submission ran very close to the deadline. Other than that, we did not face any difficulties.

7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?
    We will continue to communicate regularly and be honest with each other. I wouldn't say we really have any bad habits, or things that we need to change. It's going pretty well in general. 

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?
    We really didn't need to estimate time during the design week. The design artifacts did not take long, and they were mostly all made with haste.

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?
    We might have some small tech debt, and maybe the consumer would like the UI to look a little nicer.
