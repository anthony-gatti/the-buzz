## General questions

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)? 
    * Yes, the PM submitted this report

2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?
    * Yes, the team has been gathering for weekly in-person meetings (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday).

3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.
    * The team did a great job meething this sprint's requirements. I was impressed how quickly everyone got their part done as we aimed to complete this sprint early. Mobile and Web UI designs were done well, and everyone completed the artifacts they were responsible for.

4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
    * This sprint, everyone completed what they needed to. We ended at a good point last sprint with all the functionality of the last phase being met, so everyone is at a good starting point for the next sprint.
  
5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"
    * There were no code reviews, as this was only a design sprint

6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?
    * We completed this last sprint earlier than the deadline to give members more time to work on implementing the functionality for the current phase. I also put reminders in the slack channel to get a head start on the next sprint.

7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?
    * In our Wednesday, we discussed the functionality needed within this phase thoroughly, and on Thursday, all members expressed they could support others within the role transition.

8. How well is the team communicating?
    * Communication within the team is good. If problems arise, or members are unavailable they bring the concern to light. People are responsive in the slack when needed, although we could work on giving progress updates more frequently, without being asked. Our conversations are mainly centered around the project, but we sometimes do have casual conversations when there is time.

9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.
    * The team expectations have not changed, as there hasn't been anything new to address. The current expectations for our team is that we use the class time provided to us to go over any issues people are having, check in with each other and communicate about what still needs to be done. We also aim to check/respond in Slack more frequently, select the next PM on the last in-class meeting of the last PM, have a smooth transfer of PM by the previous PM providing a previous PM report to reference/support and  provide the Trello board and bitbucket information of all the team members, and have every team member aim to start and finish the sprint work as soon as possible.

10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.
    * No challenges arose.


## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?
    * We met with our mentor on Wednesday in CITL for about 60-75 minutes.

1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?
    * I filled out some of the requirements that each member had to complete, with some checklists if needed. Members added more details to their requirements if needed as well as assigned themselves to their corresponding tasks.

2. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?
    * On Wednesday, we went over the details of the current sprint with our mentor in detail, explaining the new functionality, and relationships between each role, making sure everyone understood what they needed to do, before ending the meeting. We completed the System Diagream and creating the new layout for tables together, so everyone was up to date. On Thursday we regrouped, to finish any artifacts still needed and recorded our video.

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Trello use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.
    * We had two team meetings through the week to work together and complete the sprint deliverables. We set deadline as to when we wanted to complete the sprint and checked in on Slack.

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?
    * No, there were no issues within managing interactions. I am really happy with our current team dynamic as people keep conversations respectful and no major problems (only expressions of frustration) have arose within members commitment or character.

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?
    * My biggest concern is everyone completing all the functionality needed for the next sprint. There is a lot of new functionality to the app, as well as adapting old functionality to appropriately benefit us onward.

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.
    * There was no significant obstacle that our team faced. The only thing that could have been a struggle is completing the design artificts by the next day after our team meeting, in order to make more time for the implementation part of the current phase.

7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?
    * We should continue to get our tasks done on time/ as soon as possible and continue to communicate with each other about challenges, or any concerns to improve our team dynamic
    * I suggest we are more transparent about our progress and what we have worked on already, so that we are not scrambling near the end to tie together any loose ends
​
8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?
    * The estimated to complete the sprint was well. We aimed to finish by a certain point and we were able to do that successfully in the time we spent together and apart.

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?
    * There are no concerns for the customer, as the functionally needed last phase were all completed so the app is working the way it should.
